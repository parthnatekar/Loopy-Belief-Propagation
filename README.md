# Loopy Belief Propagation for Binary Image Denoising

An implementation of loopy belief propagation for binary image denoising. Both sequential and parallel updates are implemented.

For running the code, run `python3 loopy_bp.py -p PATH TO IMAGE/CSV -m MODE (seq or sync) -n ADD EXTERNAL NOISE (True or False, for testing purposes)`
